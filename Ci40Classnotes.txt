maybe each peripheral type will tell the Ci40 what commands it accepts, and its data fields/state options. That way Ci40 software wont need to be updated everytime a new peripheral is released.
Or there are hardcoded devices in the hub code:
abstract device class and extended child classes for each device.


Peripheral class:
	ID
	Device Type
	List of commands
	State
	communication options: 6lowpan, wifi, zigbee. whichever protcols are avaialble
	Room?

	change state value(state value name, new value).
	get state => returns state as K/V pairs probably
	get list of commands => returns command list
	Send command(command). Sends the passed command, trying each communication option until one works.
	Add to room(room)
	remove from room
	get room
	
	
Room Class:
	ID
	Name
	List of devices
	
	get list of devices => returns all devices
	Add Device(device to add)
	Remove device(device to remove)
	
Device Manager:
	All devices
	
	Add device
	Remove device
	
Room Manager:
	All rooms
	
	Add room
	Remove room
